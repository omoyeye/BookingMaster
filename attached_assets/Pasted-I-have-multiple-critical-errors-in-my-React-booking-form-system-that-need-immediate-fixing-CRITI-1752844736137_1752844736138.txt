I have multiple critical errors in my React booking form system that need immediate fixing:

CRITICAL ERRORS TO FIX:

1. **ADMIN PAGE ERROR (BLOCKING):**
   - File: client/src/pages/admin.tsx
   - Error: "Cannot access 'parseTimeToMinutes' before initialization"
   - Issue: Function is being used before it's defined
   - Fix: Move the parseTimeToMinutes function definition BEFORE line 29 where it's first used

2. **SELECT COMPONENT ERROR (BLOCKING):**
   - Error: "A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string"
   - Issue: Some SelectItem components have empty string values
   - Fix: Find all SelectItem components with value="" and replace with valid non-empty values

3. **BOOKING FORM BROKEN REFERENCES:**
   - File: client/src/components/booking-form.tsx
   - Issues:
     a) `visibleSections` is referenced but never defined as state
     b) `showNextSection()` function is called but doesn't exist
     c) Mixed step-based and section-based navigation causing conflicts

4. **FORM NAVIGATION ERRORS:**
   - The form tries to use both `currentStep` navigation AND `visibleSections` approach
   - This creates undefined function calls and broken form flow
   - Need to choose ONE navigation pattern and implement it completely

SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:

**Fix 1 - Admin Page:**
Move parseTimeToMinutes function definition to the top of the component, before any usage.

**Fix 2 - Select Components:**
Replace any SelectItem with value="" to have proper non-empty values.

**Fix 3 - Booking Form Navigation:**
Either:
- OPTION A: Complete the step-based navigation (remove all visibleSections references)
- OPTION B: Implement proper visibleSections state management (remove step navigation)

**Fix 4 - Form Flow:**
Remove all calls to undefined functions like `showNextSection()` and replace with proper navigation logic.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Fix all console errors immediately
- Maintain existing form functionality
- Don't change form content or styling
- Ensure proper form submission and PDF generation still works
- Keep all validation and pricing calculations intact

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix admin parseTimeToMinutes error (critical - blocks admin page)
2. Fix SelectItem empty value errors
3. Choose and implement ONE navigation pattern for booking form
4. Remove all undefined function references
5. Test complete booking flow end-to-end

Please fix these errors systematically and ensure the booking system loads and functions properly without console errors.
