SECURITY ISSUE: Remove public admin account creation and insert default admin credentials

CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES NEEDED:

1. **REMOVE PUBLIC ADMIN CREATION (HIGH PRIORITY):**
   - File: client/src/pages/admin-login.tsx
   - Remove the "Create Admin Account" button and all related UI elements (lines around 136)
   - Remove the handleCreateAdmin function
   - Remove navigation to '/admin/create' route

2. **DELETE ADMIN CREATION PAGE:**
   - File: client/src/pages/admin-create.tsx
   - Delete this entire file as it's a security vulnerability
   - Remove any imports/references to this component in routing

3. **REMOVE ADMIN CREATION API ENDPOINT:**
   - File: server/routes.ts
   - Remove the entire `/api/admin/create` POST endpoint
   - This prevents any external admin account creation

4. **INSERT DEFAULT ADMIN CREDENTIALS:**
   - Create a secure way to insert the default admin into the database
   - Username: "urinak"
   - Password: "admin123!" (properly hashed)
   - Add this to the database seeding process or create a one-time setup script

5. **UPDATE ROUTING:**
   - Remove any routes that point to admin creation pages
   - Ensure only the admin login page is accessible

SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

**For admin-login.tsx:**
- Remove the entire "Create Admin Account" section (button, text, handleCreateAdmin function)
- Remove the border-t div and everything inside it
- Keep only the login form and functionality

**For server/routes.ts:**
- Remove the entire app.post("/api/admin/create", ...) endpoint
- Keep only the login endpoint

**For database setup:**
- Either add the default admin to the seed.ts file
- Or create a simple script that inserts the admin user with hashed password
- Ensure the password "admin123!" is properly hashed using bcrypt

**Security best practices:**
- No public admin creation endpoints
- No UI elements for creating admin accounts
- Only authorized database-level admin insertion
- Proper password hashing for the default admin

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Remove public admin creation button and function
2. Delete admin-create.tsx file
3. Remove /api/admin/create endpoint
4. Insert default admin credentials into database
5. Test admin login with new credentials

The goal is to have ONLY an admin login page with no way for public users to create admin accounts. The system should have one pre-configured admin account (urinak/admin123!) that can only be created through database operations, not through the web interface.
