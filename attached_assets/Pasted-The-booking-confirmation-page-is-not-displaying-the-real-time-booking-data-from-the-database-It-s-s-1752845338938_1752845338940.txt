The booking confirmation page is not displaying the real-time booking data from the database. It's showing a hardcoded fallback booking (ID 39) instead of the newly created booking.

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

1. **BOOKING FORM REDIRECT ISSUE:**
   - File: client/src/components/booking-form-wizard.tsx
   - Problem: The redirect to confirmation page is not properly passing the booking ID in the URL
   - Current redirect is not formatted correctly to include the bookingId parameter

2. **CONFIRMATION PAGE URL PARSING ISSUE:**
   - File: client/src/pages/booking-confirmation.tsx  
   - Problem: URL parameter extraction logic is failing and defaulting to hardcoded ID "39"
   - Line issue: `if (!bookingId) { bookingId = "39"; // Latest booking ID from logs }`

3. **URL STRUCTURE MISMATCH:**
   - The booking form is redirecting but not properly constructing the URL with query parameters
   - The confirmation page expects either route params or query params but receives neither

SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:

**Fix 1 - Booking Form Redirect (booking-form-wizard.tsx):**
- Locate the redirect logic after successful booking submission
- Change the redirect to properly include the booking ID as a query parameter
- Ensure the URL format is: `/booking-confirmation?bookingId=${response.id}`

**Fix 2 - Remove Hardcoded Fallback (booking-confirmation.tsx):**
- Remove the hardcoded fallback: `bookingId = "39"`
- Add proper error handling for when no booking ID is provided
- Show an error state instead of loading old booking data

**Fix 3 - URL Parameter Extraction:**
- Fix the URL parameter extraction logic to properly get bookingId from query string
- Ensure compatibility with both wouter routing and query parameters
- Test with URLs like: `/booking-confirmation?bookingId=43`

REQUIREMENTS:
- The confirmation page MUST show the actual booking data for the newly created booking
- Remove all hardcoded booking ID references
- Ensure proper URL parameter passing from form submission to confirmation
- Add proper error handling if booking ID is missing or invalid
- Test the complete flow from form submission to confirmation page display

PRIORITY:
1. Fix the redirect URL construction in booking form
2. Remove hardcoded fallback booking ID
3. Fix URL parameter extraction logic
4. Add proper error states for missing booking ID

The goal is to ensure that when a user submits a booking form, they are redirected to see THEIR booking details, not old test data.
